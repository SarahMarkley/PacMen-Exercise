Title: PacMen Exercise

Description: The Pacmen Exercise displays Pacmen who are multiplied with each click of the "add PacMan" button. In addition to the adding an additional Pacman with each click, I was also able to change the orientation of the PacMan. When the "start game" button is pressed, the Pacmen will begin to race about the page at different speed intervals. 

How to Run: In order to run the PacMen exercise, download index.html, pacmen.js, and the images which include PacMan1.png, PacMan2.png, PacMan3.png, and PacMan4.png into the same directory. Open index.html in your preferred browser. Click on the "add PacMan" button to add a PacMan; each additional click will add another PacMan onto your screen. Click on the "start game" button to watch the Pacmen race about the page at different speed intervals. 

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, it would be fun to stop one of the racing Pacmen by clicking on it, but still allowing the other Pacmen to race about the page.
